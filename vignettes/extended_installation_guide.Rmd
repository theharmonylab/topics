# Installation

The `topics` package relies on **Java** for high-performance processing. To ensure a smooth installation, please follow these two steps.

### Step 1: Install Java (Required)
Before installing the R package, you must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer.
1. Download Java from [www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
2. Restart your computer after installation to ensure R can detect the new system paths.

### Step 2: Install topics in R
Open R or RStudio and run the following commands.

```r
# Install and verify the Java interface
install.packages("topics")
```
You can also install the development version from GitHub.

```r

# Install devtools if not already present
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")

# Install topics from GitHub
devtools::install_github("theharmonylab/topics")
```

### Step 3: Memory Configuration
Topic modeling is memory-intensive. You must increase the Java memory limit before loading the library. 
If you skip this, you may encounter OutOfMemoryError during model training.

```
# Set memory limit to 5GB (Run this BEFORE loading the library)
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx5000m")
library(topics)
```
