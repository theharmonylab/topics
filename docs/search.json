Purpose: specifying sampling_interval, avoid collecting highly correlated samples, can lead robust accurate topic distributions. Example: sampling_interval = 10, algorithm collects sample every 10 iterations (e.g., iteration 10, 20, 30, etc.). Typical Values: Default: 10; Range: 5 50 (depending complexity size data). burn_in number initial iterations discarded Gibbs Sampling process. early iterations may representative final sampling distribution model still stabilizing. Purpose: burn_in period allows model converge stable state collecting samples, improving quality inferred topic distributions. Example: burn_in = 50, first 50 iterations Gibbs Sampling process discarded, sampling begins afterward. Typical Values: Default: 50 100 Range: 10 1000 (larger datasets complex models may require longer burn-period). seed (integer) seed set reproducibility. create_new_dtm (boolean) applying model new data (used training), can help make new dtm.
